# Dictionary Sort
  Sorts words by sub-string, length or both.

### Reason
  The intended use was for a game like the Fallout 4 computer hacking. I needed a way to sort different words for different difficulty levels.

### How to use
  I used the words dictionary that can be found [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
  The dictionary needs to have **each word on a different line**

  And know it's as simple as placing the file in the same folder as the .exe file and run the program.
  When the sorts is done anew file will be created in the same folder as the .exe file.

### Options
  #### By Sub-String
  Searches the entire dictionary for words that: **Starts with, Contains or Ends with** the sub-string you give it.

  #### By Length
  Seaches the entire dictionary for words with **specific length** (You can give it minimum and maximum length).
